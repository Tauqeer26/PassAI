# PassAI

Rising üåô  Solutions ‚òù 



Have you ever found yourself in a situation where you needed to extract text from an image and generate a quick response? I certainly have, and that's exactly what led me to create PassAI - a powerful tool that can help you pass tests with flying colors.



One of my friends recently reached out to me for help with a computer vision test. We agreed that he would send me an image and I would help him answer the questions. The only problem was that the PDF he sent me consisted of approximately 100 pages, and I only had a few hours to go through it. I was worried about how I would be able to solve 25 questions in just 30 minutes.



That's when I had a lightbulb moment. I realized that I could use ChatGPT to generate the answers, but the problem was that my friend would send me a picture and ChatGPT-3 doesn't accept images as input. So, I decided to create a tool that could help me extract text from the images and generate a response using the API of ChatGPT-3. And thus, PassAI was born.



PassAI is an innovative tool that I created using tkinter. It takes an image as input and uses OCR technique to extract the text from it. Once the text is extracted, PassAI uses the powerful API of ChatGPT-3 to generate a response to the given question. Thanks to PassAI, my friend was able to pass the test with flying colors.



It took me an hour to create this simple solution, and it has a lot of room of improvement.
